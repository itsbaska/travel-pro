# Travel Pro

Travel Pro is a mobile first application for group travel management.
It's easy to manage your trips when the only person you have to concern yourself is you, but if you have ever travelled in a group you know it can be really frustrating. Travel Pro helps keep everyone on the same page by keeping your itineraries, expenses and budgets all in one centralized place rather than having to sift through many weeks worth of emails and texts.
